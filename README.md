# BioForceNet
Constructed an Exercise Based Lower Limb Dataset from Lab and Wearables (WearLab Le). Based on this dataset, TCN and Transformer modules were integrated to propose a machine learning model that estimates vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and tibia bone force (TBF) using insole pressure signals.
