# BioForceNet
Constructed an Exercise Based Lower Limb Dataset from Lab and Wearables (WearLab Le). Based on this dataset, TCN and Transformer modules were integrated to propose a machine learning model that estimates vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and tibia bone force (TBF) using insole pressure signals.

# Abstract
In both military training and general fitness activities, exercise-related injuries resulting from high-intensity and repetitive impact have become a significant health concern. Among these, musculoskeletal injuries caused by unscientific training practices are predominant, affecting not only operational readiness but also significantly increasing the medical burden. The tibia, being highly susceptible to fatigue-related injuries, is currently monitored for load using costly and complex biomechanical platforms, which depend heavily on sophisticated equipment and spe-cialized expertise. Additionally, datasets suitable for analyzing lower limb load during exercise are scarce, and existing wearable technologies struggle to meet the need for continuous moni-toring of tibial force throughout the entire exercise process. In this study, we simultaneously collected data from a sports medicine platform and wearable devices (pressure insoles) used by volunteers in a laboratory setting, and calculated distributed stress on the tibia through muscu-loskeletal and finite element models, creating an Exercise-Based Lower Limb Dataset from Lab and Wearables (WearLab-Leg). Based on this dataset, we developed a machine learning model inte-grating TCN and Transformer modules to estimate vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and tibia bone force (TBF) using insole pressure signals, enabling long-term, continuous monitoring of these biomechanical forces. Furthermore, we replaced the traditional MSELoss function with a Weighted Mean Squared Error Loss (Weight-MSELoss), improving peak force prediction accuracy. Our model achieved a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 7.33% for vGRF prediction and 10.64% for TBF prediction. The dataset and proposed model offer a convenient solution for biomechanical monitoring in athletes and patients, providing reliable data support for early warnings of fatigue-induced injuries.
